After cloning the project you must run the following:
```bash
npm i # Install Node Dependencies
npm i --save-dev electron # Install electron
npm run dev # Initialize webpack in development mode
electron . # Initialize project 
```
On the file ``index.js`` there is a ``PageContent`` class that controls
every aspect of the page and game flow, there is a commented Configuration section in
the class properties which will dictate some aspects of the game.
